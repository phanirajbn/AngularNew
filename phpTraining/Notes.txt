U choose the platform and the required stack is available for development. 
We will be using WAMP to develop the php based Applications...
WAMP server allows U to install even MySQL Database. This is currently owned by Oracle but was initially an Open source product. U can still use MySql installation for performing  Simple Data centric Applications, but for commercial use, U could go for the professional licence which contain better infrastructure like Reporting services, Data Managers and many more.
Php Stack allows Ur pages to be created in a sp folder called www found in its directory. U should have admin rights to access this directory. All files and folders required for UR Application development will happen in this folder.
